    "\n",
    "Confusion Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "True Negatives (TN): 14,924\n",
    "- The model correctly identified 14,924 healthy loans (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "False Positives (FP): 77\n",
    "- The model incorrectly classified 77 healthy loans (0) as high-risk (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "False Negatives (FN): 31\n",
    "- The model incorrectly classified 31 high-risk loans (1) as healthy (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positives (TP): 476\n",
    "- The model correctly identified 476 high-risk loans (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Insights:\n",
    "Healthy Loans (Label 0):\n",
    "\n",
    "- With 14,924 true negatives and only 77 false positives, the model is excellent at identifying healthy loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-Risk Loans (Label 1):\n",
    "\n",
    "- While the model accurately identified 476 high-risk loans, it missed 31 high-risk loans (false negatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a breakdown of the Classification Report and what it tells us about the model’s performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification Report Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class 0 (Healthy Loans):\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: 1.00\n",
    "- The model is incredibly precise in predicting healthy loans, meaning it rarely misclassifies loans as high-risk when they are actually healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: 0.99\n",
    "- The model is able to correctly identify 99% of all healthy loans in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-Score: 1.00\n",
    "- A perfect balance between precision and recall, reflecting exceptional performance for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class 1 (High-Risk Loans):\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: 0.86\n",
    "\n",
    "- 86% of the loans predicted as high-risk are truly high-risk loans, indicating a slight tendency to classify healthy loans as high-risk (false       positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: 0.94\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model successfully identifies 94% of all high-risk loans, showing good sensitivity toward this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-Score: 0.90\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indicates strong performance overall for high-risk loans but leaves room for improvement in precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Accuracy: 0.99\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model correctly classifies 99% of loans overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macro Average:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision: 0.93\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall: 0.97\n",
    "\n",
    "- F1-Score: 0.95\n",
    "\n",
    "This average treats both classes equally, showing that the model performs well on both classes, with a slight edge for healthy loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted Average:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision, Recall, F1-Score: 0.99 each\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics are weighted by the number of samples in each class, favoring the more frequent healthy loans (class 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations:\n",
    "The imbalance in the dataset is evident, with 75,036 healthy loans (class 0) versus 2,500 high-risk loans (class 1). Despite this imbalance, the model performs well on both classes. Class 1 (high-risk loans) has lower precision than recall, which could indicate a need for better differentiation between high-risk and healthy loans to reduce false positives.The weighted metrics show that the model overall is extremely accurate due to the dominance of healthy loans in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "For Deployment:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is highly effective overall and can be recommended for deployment with confidence, especially if correctly identifying high-risk loans (recall) is prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider techniques such as oversampling the minority class (e.g., SMOTE) or tweaking decision thresholds to further improve precision for class 1.\n",
    "Explore alternative models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to see if they provide better performance for high-risk loans."
